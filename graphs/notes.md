## Graphs Introductions

A graph is a collection of nodes and edges. The nodes contain data and the edges connects those nodes.
Voltex == Node
A graph is a grid describing the relationship between things.
e.g. We can say the nodes are cities and the edges are the roads connecting this cities or the nodes are courses and the edges are prerequisites.
Directed graphs are one ways street while undirected graphs are two ways street.
Neighbour nodes are any nodes that are accesible thru an edge as long as it obeys the direction of the edge

## Depth First Traversal

Depth first traversal is exploring one direction as far as possible before stwitching directions
Depth first algorithm uses a stack
stack is basically a vertical data structure
stack is last in first out

## Breadth first traversal

Breadth first traversal explore all directions evenly, instead of favoring one direction all the way through
Breadth first travesal uses a queue
queue is first in first out
